What's New:
1. Added a 'Search' button to filter information within the database.

2. Added a 'Clear' button that allow users to reset the input fields before submitting data to the database. This button is only enabled when the user has entered some information.

3. Added a 'Log Out' button to complement the existing login functionality.

4. Added a 'Sign Up' button and a 'Confirm Password' field to properly create an account. The admin login page now serves a dual purpose: if the entered credentials exist, click Login; if not, click Sign Up, and a Confirm Password field will appear.

5. Implemented a username availability checker during sign-up to prevent duplicate accounts.

6. Passwords are now hidden (displayed as bullets) for improved security.

7. Added a title to the admin login page.
